# Burp pyTemplate Extension

## Description 

This Burp extension generates automatically a minimalist Python script replaying any request(s) seen in Burp:
  * In "Proxy"
  * In "Repeater"
  * In "Site map"

The generated Python script can then be used as a basis to write more advanced injection exploitation script (complex SQL injection, recursive local files download, site crawling ...)
